what makes each graph on BFSIterative.java and Graph.java different 
is that, IMO, their view points: Edge or Vertex.

Graph on BFSIterative.java has a simpler implementation of Graph
because it constructs graph using its constructor. 
(It just overwrite data so it doesn't matter add some same data.) 

I think the former one uses index (Edge and Vertex).
i.e. Edge is kind of index and through the Edge we can get some data in Node instance.
While the latter one uses data directly (Vertex).
i.e. we can get some data directly through the Vertex.
